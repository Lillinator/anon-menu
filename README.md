# Discoures Anon-Menu
Discourse anon-menu lets admins specify a custom navigation menu section to show to only anonymous (not-logged-in) users and a section for only logged-in users.

There are two settings that can be used (indivually or together): a custom navigation menu section to show only for anonymous users, and another to show only for logged-in users.
Create custom global navigation menu sections by click/tapping the plus (+) icon at the botton of the navigation sidebar menu.  This will bring up the create custom section modal.  
Once you create the links, make sure to enable the checkbox next to "Make this section public and visible to everyone". 
If you enable and setup the component settings first before making the global sections (and remember the names you input in the field(s), you can keep those sections from appearing for all before you enable the component in your theme.
